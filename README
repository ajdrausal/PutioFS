== PutioFS

This is a very early release and the implementation is far from complete.
However, interested developers are invited to contribute at this early stage in
order to produce a better architecture. The current version is programmed by
Firat Can Basarir and it is time to open it to the community.

Right now, it only works on Windows but the core implementation is platform independent. When the Fuse callback functions are implemented, it should work on Linux and Mac OS X. PutioFS depends on Dokan library to be installed. The latest version can be found at http://dokan-dev.net/en/download/#dokan.

PutioFS is a cross-platform virtual file system built using C#. It uses Put.io
.NET API and Dokan.Net to create a virtual drive that provides seamless access
to the files on your Put.io account as if they are on the local disk. It does
NOT synchronize your Put.io account to the disk. Files are fetched on demand
(parts of files are streamed only when a process READs it) and cached on the
disk.

== Technical Information

PutioFS uses DokanNet on Windows and Mono.Fuse on Mac OS X and Linux based
systems. The core consists of a <PutioFile> class that implements a FileStream
interface which can be conveniently used to implement the required Dokan/FUSE
functions.

Right now, cache files are pre-allocated on the disk which is far from optimal.
When a process reads a few bytes from a 2GB file, 2GBs on local disk allocated
for that file. Background threads download a file according to the position of
the file handles and recent reads.

This download mechanism is the core of this project and should be improved
significantly in order to make it usable.
